## Iteration 2 Retrospective
### What went well?
Once again, we managed to implement all of the user stories that were proposed with the respective unit and acceptance tests. The communication and collaboration between
the team members also showed to be quite effective and productive.

### What didn't go so well?
Having multiple projects and tests of other course units running at the same time, the team spent less time focusing on this particular project, leaving once again
the majority of the work load to the last days.

### What have we learned?
We learned that communication between group/team members is the key to producing high quality work. Whenever someone is struggling, the most effective way of overcoming
that obstacle is asking the other members for help.

### What still puzzles us?
Why can't we be more effective in terms of managing our time and tasks?
