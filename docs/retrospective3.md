## Iteration 3 Retrospective
### What went well?
We implemented the user story planned for the iteration in question.

### What didn't go so well?
We didn't realize how laborious and difficult the feature we planned to implement was in reality.

### What have we learned?
We learned not to overestimate our abilities and to be realistic about what we can and can't do.

### What still puzzles us?
Why can't we progress and evolve our capabilities?
