## Iteration 1 Retrospective
### What went well?
We managed to implement the user stories that were proposed with the respective unit and acceptance tests. The team members collaborated well with each other
and there was good communication.

### What didn't go so well?
With the extension of the deadline the team relaxed a bit and left the majority of the work to the last days.

### What have we learned?
We learned not to leave a lot of work to the last days. Also, we came to the conclusion that it can be very productive to 
communicate with other teams to have a different perspective on the various aspects of the project.

### What still puzzles us?
Why did we, with such a large timeframe, left the work to the last days?
